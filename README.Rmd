An R package to get Breaking Bad quotes!

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oFzmkkwfOGlzZ0gxi/giphy.gif)

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("jiwanheo/rBreakingBad")
```

## Usage

The main function of this package is `one_who_knocks`. By default, it messages and invisibly returns one random quote from the show. It can take a `quote_id` argument, which can look up and return a quote by ID, as well as `quote_by` argument, that takes a name of a character, and returns a random quote from them.

```{r example}
library(rBreakingBad)

one_who_knocks()
one_who_knocks(quote_id = 1)
one_who_knocks(quote_by = "Jesse Pinkman")
```
