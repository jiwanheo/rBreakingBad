## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("jiwanheo/rBreakingBad")
```

## Usage

The main function of this package is `one_who_knocks`. By default, it messages and invisibly returns one random quote from the show. 

```{r example}
library(rBreakingBad)

one_who_knocks(message = TRUE)
```

It can take one of two arguments, `quote_id` and `quote_by`. 

`quote_id` looks up and returns a specific quote by ID, whereas `quote_by` argument takes the name of a character, and returns a random quote from them.

```{r example_with_params}
one_who_knocks(quote_id = 1)
one_who_knocks(quote_by = "Jesse Pinkman")
```
