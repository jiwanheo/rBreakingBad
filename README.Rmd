An R package to get Breaking Bad quotes!

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oFzmkkwfOGlzZ0gxi/giphy.gif)

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("jiwanheo/rBreakingBad")
```

## Usage

The main function of this package is `one_who_knocks`. By default, it messages and invisibly returns one random quote by any of the main characters in the show. It can also take a `quote_id` argument, which specifies the quote to return.

```{r example}
library(rBreakingBad)

one_who_knocks(quote_id = NULL, message = TRUE)
```
